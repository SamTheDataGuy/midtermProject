LHL DS May 29th Cohort Midterm Project (Mehzabeen, Nasser, Sam)

## Question
- How do nearby ammenities affect the popularity, price, and ratings of hotels in downtown Toronto?

## Method
- Use data from Yelp and Google Places APIs (maybe Hotels.com or Tripadvisor)

## Steps
- Pull hotel data from Google Places or Hotels.com API
- Build a function that pulls all nearby ammenities for each hotel (using longitude and latitude)
- Test function with 1 or 2 hotels
- Once we're getting the data we want, run the function with all hotels
- Perform EDA to see if we can gain some insights on the data, and confirm what data needs to be cleaned
- Clean data
- Perform further analysis
-
